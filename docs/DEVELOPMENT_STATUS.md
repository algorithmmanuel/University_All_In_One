# Development handover

**Last updated:** 26 October 2026 (Africa/Lagos).  
**Checkpoint:** owner verified isolated development frontend/API/database readiness on Windows and confirmed beta still responds. Synthetic learner browser verification remains pending.  
**Roadmap:** [approved plan](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md).

## How to resume

Read this file and the roadmap, select `feature/beta-continuous-improvement`, inspect current Git status and relevant source, and continue from the next action below. Do not assume that the default branch represents the current web/API project.

- Development branch: `feature/beta-continuous-improvement`.
- Tester-facing beta branch: `feature/secure-password-recovery`.
- The development worktree was created from the same committed source as beta.
- The owner has verified the local setup through terminal output. The assistant inspected repository code but did not directly operate the owner's computer.
- Local development setup files have not yet been uploaded merely by creating this documentation.
- Treat runtime locations, connection details, credentials, backup metadata and raw feedback as private local information. Ask for fresh, sanitised diagnostics when needed rather than recording these details in Git.

## Completed with owner-supplied evidence

- [x] Exported all feedback in a consistent read-only snapshot and reconciled the record count.
- [x] Reviewed feedback and approved the revised eight-phase roadmap.
- [x] Checked beta application and database readiness.
- [x] Created a logical database backup and verified its checksum.
- [x] Restored that backup into a temporary isolated database.
- [x] Verified restored migration and representative aggregate counts against the baseline.
- [x] Removed the temporary recovery container and retained the backup locally.
- [x] Created a separate development Git worktree and branch.
- [x] Added local Git exclusions for backup, export and generated build directories.
- [x] Created a separate development database, credentials and persistent volume.
- [x] Created a separate development Python environment.
- [x] Applied database migrations to the expected source revision.
- [x] Seeded demonstration courses, lessons and quizzes.
- [x] Confirmed development contains no copied beta learner accounts, feedback or mission records.
- [x] Owner ran the development isolation check successfully: frontend and API process identities matched; database identity and schema readiness passed.
- [x] Owner confirmed the existing beta frontend and API health still returned HTTP 200.

Recovery evidence establishes successful logical snapshot restoration and the stated checks. It does not establish off-site retention, encryption, point-in-time recovery, service recovery time or a complete application recovery drill.

## Exact next action

**Verify a complete synthetic learner journey in the isolated development browser, then prepare the baseline security audit.**

1. Use only the development browser origin and create a synthetic adult Student account through the account page. Do not use a real password, beta invitation or beta learner account.
2. Sign in and verify the dashboard loads.
3. Enrol in a demonstration course, complete one lesson, refresh/reopen the course and verify completion persists.
4. Submit a course assessment and verify results are displayed.
5. Start a mission, save a decision, reload and resume, then finish it and verify history. Check both visual modes where available.
6. Submit a clearly labelled development-only feedback entry, sign out, verify a protected page redirects to sign-in, then sign in again and confirm saved state remains.
7. Record actual pass/fail results. Frontend typecheck/unit-test output has not been independently supplied in this checkpoint; request it if needed rather than assuming it passed.
8. Review the existing local non-secret Compose definition before committing it. Review legacy test/synchronisation branch assumptions before running database-writing suites.
9. Read and pin the Cloudflare audit skill and prepare its required execution sandbox before a full baseline audit. Keep the beta running and unchanged.

## Implemented source changes and checks

- Configurable server-side API/health proxy with validation; existing beta default and reset-password security headers preserved.
- Home game-library and logout requests now default to same-origin browser requests. Server-rendered pathway requests use the configured frontend origin.
- Guarded development launcher explicitly selects the development database and local services, removes inherited beta application/mail settings, refuses occupied ports and never runs migrations automatically.
- Development-only non-secret process identity endpoint; ordinary beta mode does not register it. The verification command requires direct and frontend-proxied identities to match.
- Added development requirements and a local startup/verification runbook. Existing local Compose setup remains pending review/commit.
- Focused verification in the assistant workspace: 6 Python unittest guard cases and 4 Node proxy/configuration cases passed. Python syntax compilation passed. These checks used no live beta database or mail service.
- Subsequent owner-supplied Windows output verifies successful development service startup and the runtime isolation check, plus continued beta HTTP health. This supports successful application startup but is not a full regression or browser result.
- Frontend typecheck/unit-test results, full regression suite and browser journeys have not been independently supplied at this checkpoint.

## Outstanding work

- [x] Development frontend routing configuration implemented and runtime identity matching verified by the owner.
- [x] Startup configuration loading and inherited-environment guards implemented and unit tested.
- [x] Development API/frontend running; owner verified runtime isolation and database/schema readiness.
- [ ] Synthetic learner journey verified in the development browser.
- [ ] Dependency baseline comparison and controlled reproducibility plan. Broad requirements ranges were used during setup; do not assume development and beta installed identical versions.
- [ ] Real-backend browser and regression checks.
- [ ] Versioned release/recovery procedures and application-version feedback metadata.
- [ ] Cloudflare security-audit skill read at a pinned upstream revision, installed and executed under its required sandbox controls.
- [ ] Feedback-driven learning and mission improvements.
- [ ] Later phases of the approved roadmap.

The Cloudflare audit has not been run. No full regression suite or new learner-feature acceptance tests have run during this checkpoint. Focused isolation checks and successful migration/seeding are not replacements for those checks.

## Working tree and source-control notes

The last beta status included a generated frontend declaration-file modification, which was preserved. Inspect it before deciding whether any action is needed; do not reset or stage it automatically.

The development setup created a non-secret Compose definition, an ignored credential file and a local Python environment. Only the appropriate reviewed source/configuration belongs in Git. Local exclusions do not replace a reviewed repository-wide ignore policy.

## Continuation and maintenance rules

The owner wants complete corrected PowerShell blocks whenever commands need changing, rather than replacement fragments.

After each verified milestone, update this file with:
- date and evidence source;
- relevant source changes and commit references;
- checks actually run and their results;
- unresolved issues;
- one concrete next action.

Refresh actual Git/runtime state at the beginning of a new session. Keep beta testing open, develop against separate data and do not mark proposed commands as completed work. Do not commit private operational metadata or raw tester data.
